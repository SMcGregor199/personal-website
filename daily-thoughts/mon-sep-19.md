# Some Thoughts for September 19th

# Accessiblity 
- `<a> ` tags need an href attribute in order to be accessible. 

# Tower
- Rather than create a new branch of an older iteration of a website, if you're looking for a specific file, you can use tower to restore the file to the working copy. 

# Java 
- `public static void main(String[]args) { }` is the entry point for any java application 
- `public class FileName { }` is a class that contains the main method, and it's name must be the same as the application, ie. `FileName.java`
