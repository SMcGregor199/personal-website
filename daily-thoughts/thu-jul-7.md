# Some Thoughts for July 7th

With *Exercise for Programmers* by my side, today has been all about learning how to work with JavaScript. I threw in some PHP as well, but my biggest growth area came in the form of learning JavaScrtipt and how to use JavaScript to interact with the HTML. 

## Cool Code Tidbit

- When using JavaScript to create forms, I can think of the `prompt()` function as a sort of simple form. 
- Any time I'm creating an element or searching for an element on the page I will write it as 	`document.createElement()` and `document.querySelector()` respectively.

## Thoughts on JavaScript 

A Yo! JavaScript is interesting, but I'm glad to know that I'm starting to get a hold of it. I worked on PHP earlier today, but I was able to fall back on some of the things I remember from when I was first learning PHP. I made some pretty important leaps in JavaScript today. 

## The Leaps I made
### To merge or not to merge, that is the question. 
Do you write JavaScript inside HTML or do you keep JavaScript and HTML separate. Svelte encourages you to write everything altogether, but there's a different approach that says to keep JavaScript and the HTML separate.
