# Some Thoughts for July 2nd

I am now three weeks into my fellowship with Campaign Zero, and this feels like as good a time as any to take stock of where I was before I started the fellowship, where I currently am, and where I'd like to be by the fellowship's end on July 29th. 

## Things I knew before the fellowship 
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- WordPress (I would say I had a pretty decent grasp of WordPress) 

## Things I'm currently learning in the fellowship 
- Svelte 
- JavaScript
- Node.js 
- Tailwind 
- Tangential files (prettierrc, eslintrc, etc.)
- Project workflow 

## Some thoughts on where I'd like to be by the end of the fellowship on July 29th 
 
 With a full-time job! lol. But seriously though, I want to work. 

 With all these new skills under my belt, I want to completely revamp my website. I don't want to transition my site into a framework. I think I do my best learning when I dealing directly with the HTML without all the abstraction that many frameworks offer. Relatedly, I also want to completely revamp my resume, specifically I want to add more technical web development language to it. I'm hoping that between these skills, a new website, and a new resume, I'll be in an infinitly stronger position to land a full-time job somewhere.
