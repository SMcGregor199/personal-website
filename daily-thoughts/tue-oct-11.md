# Some Thoughts for October 11th 

## Goal: To get 1% better every day
- When creating a thumbnail for a pixel art gallery project, the dimensions in affinity designer should ideally be `w:580px` and `h:440px`
- to rename an admin password in wordpress with sequel pro, you need to click on the query tab and type 
`UPDATE wp_users
SET user_pass= MD5('password')
WHERE ID = 1`
and run the code. this will reset the password to 'password'
