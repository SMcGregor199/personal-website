# HOW THE INTERNET WORKS BY ARTICLE 19 AND CATNIP
### Things I learned 

There are three types of networks 

1. Decentralized (most of the internet) - many clients connect to many routers that connect to each other. 
2. Centralized - many clients connect through a single router. 
3. Distributed - all nodes are both servers and clients. All nodes are non-hierarchically connected to each other. 

Nodes that provide services over a network are called **servers**

Nodes that use a service are called **clients**

**Routers** are what allow connections between different networks. 

- This seemingly is what allows for the “decentralized” internet
