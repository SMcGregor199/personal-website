# Some Thoughts for October 6th 

## Goal: To get 1% better every day

On today's episode of getting 1% better, I 
- worked with using the inline stlye attribute. I know how to add multiple styles on a single inline stlye attribute. 
- Got experience using `background-image` and `background-repeat: space` in order to create a repeating image 
- Reminded myself that `position: absolute` works in conjunction with the closest `position:relative` element, and through a combination of `top`,`left`,`right`, and `bottom`, you can position an element inside another element pretty easily. 
- learned the importance of thinking out loud. 
- `cd ..` lets you go 'up' in whatever directory you're in
- `cd ~` lets you go all the way back to the root directory 
- When you set something like `margin-bottom` or `gap` to an element at a specific media query, it keeps that style even when it switches to a larger viewport size. You need to explicit change that media query if you want it to look different. 

## Between my personal projects and my work with CZ, can I get 2% every day? That would equal to roughly me being 75x better web developer than I am now.
