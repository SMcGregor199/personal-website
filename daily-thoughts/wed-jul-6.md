# Some Thoughts for July 6th

Today was a huge day. I got some extraordinary affirmations from my summer manager today, and I started on my first exercise from Brian Hogan's *Exercise for Programmers.* I also have a clear sense of what I'll be doing with my portfolio site moving forward. 

## Cool Coding Tidbit of the day
Double Quotes in PHP allows for string interpolation 

example `<?php
			$message = "Hello $name. It's nice to meet you"
			?>`

## Design Thoughts
Pieces for my portfolio will consist 1 of either 
 
- A large graphic of the website
- A collage of images related to the website 
- a video of the site walkthrough
**I'd also like there to be a cool graphic that combines the logo of the framework w/ the theme/mascot of the project** 

Pieces for my portfolio will also have 1-2 paragraphs describing what I was trying to accomplish as well as how I accomplished it. 

Pieces for my portfolio will also consist of bullet points outlining the specific web technologies used.
