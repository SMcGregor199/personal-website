- `.json()` is a method for taking JSON data and parsing it to produce a javaScript object. That's why after you use `.json()` on a fetch request you can then treat the resulting data as a javaScript object, including the using the `.` notation to retirve key values pairs inside the object. 
- `cURL` is a utility for fetching api data
- to create `categories` in WordPress, you need to go to the `POSTS` and click categories. To add categories to a custom post type, you need to go where you create that post type in `CPT UI` and under `taxonomies` add categories and tags if you'd like
- you can enable users to switch between the classic and block editor by enabling the classic editor plugin and inside `settings -> writing` you can allow users to switch between the two
- `fetch` allows a second parameter, in which you can specify how you want the data retrieved.

- pages in wordpress are for static content while content related to post types will be dynamically generated.
