# Some Thoughts for September 22nd

## Java
- In order to compile and execute a java application on your computer, using Sublime text, you first need to download a JDK (Java Development Kit). This always you to use `javac` and `java` commands in the terminal to compile and execute a java application in the terminal. 
- java variables are strongly typed, meaning variables need to be defined first (i.e. `int`, `boolean`,`String`,`double`,`char`) before they are definied. 
- `char` variabales are encased in single quotes whereas `String` are encased in double quotes.
