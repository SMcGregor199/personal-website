# Setting Up A Rap Blog on Digital Ocean with Plesk 

### Things I learned 

1. It's important to remember to delete any extraneous index.html 
files when uploading the the website files with the Plesk Panel. 
2. When setting up WP sites with Plesh, remember to make sure the 
the Plesk user accessing the database is the same as the the DB 
name and password in the wp-config file. 
3. Ensure the DNS resolves correctly by adding `A @ [I.P Address]`
and `A www [I.P Address]`
