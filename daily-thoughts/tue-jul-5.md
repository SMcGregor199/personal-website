# Some Thoughts for July 5th

We're now one day removed from independence day in the United States, and I'm starting my week by looking over the tangential (there likely is a better name out there somewhere) files and folders that make up a website code base. Working indepently, I've become familiar with what in the indsutry is referred to as "source" files or "src" or short. These files, to the best of knowledge typically consist of the data, the components, and the pages. But there are usually other files that make up a website's codebase, particularly when it's being made at scale with multiple frameworks. Belowing I'll be detailing the several tangential files that I've come across in my research and studies.
