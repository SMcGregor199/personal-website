# Some Thoughts for September 13th

My boss helped me through some database stuff with wordpress but it was hard as hell. 

## Question 
If someone creates a project and creates a repo of that project, why is it that when I pull that project down, I still have to install a bunch of other packages????? 

## Things to keep in mind  
When I clone a WordPress repo, I need remember to "import" the database using either PHPMyAdmin or Sequel Pro ( these are just interfaces through which you can interact with the database in the same way that I might use Sublime text to interact with JSON ). This database will have a .sql extension. In some cases, I'll need to find and replace certain values within the database so that it will work.
