# PHP Development

### Things I learned 

`ini_set()`

&nbsp 'display_errors','1'

&nbsp 'display_errors','0'

> The above function changes a specific configuration setting within PHP that allows you to control whether or not PHP errors are displayed in the browser output '1' instructs PHP to display errors. '0' reverts to the default setting. This is a good setting to set at the top of your PHP development file.

`error_reporting()`

&nbsp E_ALL

[Documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting)

> It's a function that sets the current error reporting level, controlling which types of errors PHP will report during script execution. `E_ALL` is a predefined constant that instructs PHP to report **all** possible errors, warnings, and notices.

Example:

`ini_set('display_errors','1'); error_reporting(E_ALL); echo $myVariable;`

Output:

> **Notice**: Undefined variable: myVariable in **/Users/shaynemcgregor/a-rap-blog-wp/wp-content/themes/a-rap-blog/front-page.php** on line **3**

Summary:

> `ini_set()` It doesn't influence which errors are detected or reported; it only governs their visibility. error_reporting() governs the kinds of errors that are reported.
