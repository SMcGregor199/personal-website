# Welcome to Shayne McGregor's Web Dev Repo

Yo what's up? Welcome to my repo, which mostly just contains the source files for my personal website, which you can check out [here](https://www.shaynemcgregor.dev) if you'd like to learn more about what makes me tick. 




## Why you might want to stay and peruse 

1. Well...beyond looking at how I like to organize my files, and how I like to write code, you can also check out my [daily thoughts folder](https://github.com/SMcGregor199/personal-website/tree/main/daily-thoughts), which contains my (mostly) cohesive daily thoughts as a web developer. Take peek. Check out the things I've been reading, coding, learning, writing etc.  

2. You also might be interested in my [projects folder](https://github.com/SMcGregor199/personal-website/tree/main/projects). Here you can check out the code for my projects, but..really...the more interesting thing might be my case studies which you can check out on my personal website. 




## My hopes

After looking at this repo, I hope you leave with a sense of..."wow, this guy really knows what he's doing" or, at the very least, you leave thinking "I like how clearly he names his files." If nothing else, I hope you leave with an interest in getting to know me better. Check out my website above, or send me an email at **shaynemcgregor1@gmail.com**
