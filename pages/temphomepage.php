		<h1 class="title-voice">I am Shayne McGregor Ph.D.</h1>

		<h2 class="sub-title-voice">PHP and JavaScript Developer</h2>

		<p>My mentor once told me the following:</p>

		<blockquote>"Knowledge itself is not power. Knowledge put into action is power."</blockquote>

		<p>As a web developer, I support putting knowledge into action by leveraging the internet as a tool to educate and empower others.</p>

		<h2 class="sub-title-voice">Current Role</h2>
		<p> Right now I work as a contract web developer with Campaign Zero, a non-profit dedicated to ending police violence in the United States.</p>

		<h2 class="sub-title-voice">Fun note about me:</h2>
		<p>Raised in the Republic of Brooklyn in the ‘90s and early ‘00s, I was nurtured by hip-hop and internet culture.</p>

		<h2 class="sub-title-voice">Care to stay in touch?</h2>
