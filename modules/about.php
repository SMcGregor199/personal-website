	<p class="paragraph-voice">I want to find a company where I can continue to expand my skillset as a developer and designer. Because writing is such a big part of who I am, I also want to write 50 blog posts by the end of the year. Click below to learn more about my specific goals and stay up-to-date on my progress.</p>
