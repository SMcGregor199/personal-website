				<h2>Immigration</h2>
				<p>My father, who I didn't know, returned to Kenya when I was just two. This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an <a href="?">employer undercuts</a> American wages by hiring illegal workers.</p>

	        <p>"While studying here, my father met my mother. Our Party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer. And it's around this time that some pastors I was working with came up to me and asked if I was a member of a church. So doing the Lord's work is a thread that's run through our politics since the very beginning. We will all have to make concessions to achieve this. No, the word is very near."</p>
