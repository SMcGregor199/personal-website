She can\u2019t imagine how waiting tables at a 24-hour pancake diner and moving in with too many weird roommates could possibly change that.

In part, Moby-Dick is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.","genre":2,"book-cover":"https:\/\/peprojects.dev\/images\/portrait.jpg"},"a622a68a06941a":{"title":"Don Quixote","author":"Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra","blurb":"Don Quixote has become so entranced by reading chivalric romances that he determines to become a knight-errant himself.

With lyrical precision, psychological directness, resonating symbolic power, and a rage that is at once unrelenting and compassionate, Baldwin chronicles a fourteen-year-old boy's discovery of the terms of his identity as the stepson of the minister of a storefront Pentecostal church in Harlem one Saturday in March of 1935. Baldwin's rendering of his protagonist's spiritual, sexual, and moral struggle of self-invention opened new possibilities in the American language and in the way Americans understand themselves. \t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t","genre":2,"book-cover":"https:\/\/peprojects.dev\/images\/portrait.jpg"},"a622b82f9865a8":{"title":"In the Wake: On Blackness and Being","author":"Christina Sharpe","blurb":"In this original and trenchant work, Christina Sharpe interrogates literary, visual, cinematic, and quotidian representations of Black life that comprise what she calls the \"orthography of the wake.\" Activating multiple registers of \"wake\"\u2014the path behind a ship, keeping watch with the dead, coming to consciousness\u2014Sharpe illustrates how Black lives are swept up and animated by the afterlives of slavery, and she delineates what survives despite such insistent violence and negation. Initiating and describing a theory and method of reading the metaphors and materiality of \"the wake,\" \"the ship,\" \"the hold,\" and \"the weather,\" Sharpe shows how the sign of the slave ship marks and haunts contemporary Black life in the diaspora and how the specter of the hold produces conditions of containment, regulation, and punishment, but also something in excess of them. In the weather, Sharpe situates anti-Blackness and white supremacy as the total climate that produces premature Black death as normative. Formulating the wake and \"wake work\" as sites of artistic production, resistance, consciousness, and possibility for living in diaspora, In the Wake offers a way forward.\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t","genre":0,"book-cover":"https:\/\/peprojects.dev\/images\/portrait.jpg"},"a622b9a5ba194a":{"title":"Shayne's World The Sequel","author":"Shayne McGregor","genre":"4","blurb":"Enter the New World","book-cover":"https:\/\/peprojects.dev\/images\/portrait.jpg"},"a622cb83d2e52b":{"title":"The Book","author":"The Author","blurb":"The Blurb\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t","genre":2,"book-cover":"https:\/\/peprojects.dev\/images\/portrait.jpg"},"a622cb87d53d76":{"title":"The Book","author":"Derek","blurb":"\t\t\t\r\n\t\tThe Book\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t","genre":0,"book-cover":"https:\/\/peprojects.dev\/images\/portrait.jpg"},"a622cbc277e3d5":{"title":" ","author":"derek","blurb":"the blurb\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t","genre":0,"book-cover":"https:\/\/peprojects.dev\/images\/portrait.jpg"},"a622cbc5a0174c":{"title":" ","author":"derek","blurb":"the blurb\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t","genre":0,"book-cover":"https:\/\/peprojects.dev\/images\/portrait.jpg"},"a622cbc609adae":{"title":"derek ","author":"derek","blurb":"\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tthe blurb\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t","genre":0,"book-cover":"https:\/\/peprojects.dev\/images\/portrait.jpg"}}
