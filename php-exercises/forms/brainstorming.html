#Mad Libs 

<!-- Problem Statement: How do I create a form such that when the user leaves a field blank, the message that is produced includes "Enter $variable here" along with the rest of the madlib. -->

<!-- I can intialize the variable defaults to be "Enter $variable here," but that causes an issue where those defaults will be displayed in the message after the screen reloads, right? Test: This causes an issue where those default messages are included in the text fields as their default value. The user needs to delete them before they can type anything -->

<!-- What if I reassign the variables inside the conditional statement? -->
