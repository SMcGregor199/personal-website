This is a story about a man who learns to forgive his father for not being around, because as a adult he finds the he is just like him or making the same mistakes. 

The song making the same mistakes as his father to different degrees. One turns into gun fights and the other is more subtle and turns into a heist.

On a Saturday, Jasmine is repeatedly coming on into the living room and jumping on me expecting me to pick her up. All I want to do is sit on the couch and watch television. 

I feel like there’s an emotional block stopping me from sharing with Jasmine how I feel. For some reason, I get the sense that she doesn’t listen or care.

Is man a fallen-angel or a risen ape? 




I want to believe in God, but if I believe in God it won’t be because some body just told me to believe in him, it’ll be because I got to know him personally. I built a personal relationship with him.


Something needs to be admitted. It was acknowledged earlier, but it needs to be admitted.

You’re not equipped to deal with my emotions. And it’s not because the stuff I go through is particularly bad. It’s because you weren’t socialized the be attentive to a man’s emotions. Not at the level that I’ve been socialized to be attentive to your emotions. When you’re feeling a certain way with respect to your family, friends, or work, it doesn’t matter how I’m feeling, I need to be able to be attentive to what and how you’re feeling.  

So we have a communications issues, but at the heart of that issue is a misalignment between what you say you want and what you actually want. For whatever reason you SAY you want a man who is in tune with his emotions, but you don’t actually want that. You’re not equipped for that. It annoys you it frustrates you. 

I’m having a panic attack in the park. My chest hurts. I’m bent over. I look up and see Jasmine’s face. She’s stonefaced with a look that read’s “This nigga.” 

Jasmine’s level of selfishness is scary. I could be having a panic attack in the park, clutching my chest, but because she’s so consumed by her emotions, she actually won’t care. 

She still interrupted be twice yesterday as I was trying to explain my thoughts and feelings. That was her trying to be sincere. Imagine how you are on a regular day. 

She’s almost 30 years old and she let’s her emotions direct her behavior. 

Jasmine does not listen to me. If I tell her to leave something on the counter, even if it’s right next to her, she’ll intentionally do something different. “I’m already walking over to you.“ Rebellious for no reason.

Scene 1
It was a success. After thirty-plus years of toil and tears, of new joys and new pains, of old pains hovering in the evening sunset of new-found happiness, and, no matter the cost, of prioritizing that happiness in the face of every excuse that told her not to…of bringing old traditions to bear on new relationships, of family get-togethers, and, ultimately, of living as an American in these United States, Lisa S. Crawford, the one who held the unique honor of giving birth (her second child) to her family’s first American relative (a child whose father was a madman, but that’s a whole different story), had finally, miraculously even, made it back to Jamaica. And would you believe she made it back, on that day in the summer of 2014 after walking outside Sangster International Airport, pass all the men in grey uniforms and into the throng of people, Jamaicans mostly, a richer woman than when she first left the island all those years ago?
What year was it? 1982 or ’83 when she, wearing the blue dress she normally reserved for Sunday service and other special occasions, a blue dress she picked up while shopping in Brownstown market one day and that complimented her light brown skin and bun-tied hair, found herself surrounded by seven people (there was her sisters Elaine, Dana, May, Rose,  Jada, Rachel, as well as cousin Daisy), at the very same airport, Sangster, ready to meet her husband-to-be (the madman) for the very first time.
Vashon listened with only passing interest.  some with signs bearing the names of
the American U.S. officer, lightskin who had an affinity for jazz (in the 1980s?), her husband for 18 years, before  The good seats on JetBlue this time.   (because JetBlue actually has exclusive rights to most of the nonstop flights),  seats   Chrome gray skies shielded the city. Vashon Harrison Crawford made his way to McCampbells Jamaican restaurant following the end of his class in English Comp II and a quick trip to the library to print out the readings for the following week. What was the reading on again? Something related to someone named Ford Madox Ford. The class went as well as he had hoped. One hour and fifteen minutes came and went without him having to say a word. He’ll have to make up for the missed participation points by doing really well on the second essay assignment, but, then again, he didn’t care for the class that much anyway.   Anyway, It’s 1pm.
His glasses became foggy. At the same time the bell sounds, signaling the entrance of a new customer, Vashon inhales the scent of jerk seasoning and exhales the knowledge that the local Jamaican spot, officially known as McCampbell’s according the slightly tattered burgundy awning hanging above the main entrance, indeed still had jerk chicken on the menu.  It was only 12:30 in the early afternoon, a Friday, but Vashon was well familiar with how McCampbell’s was regularly out of jerk chicken come rush hour.
Doreen, with her hair tied in the chefs net, looking cute in a way.
Vashon walks up to counter and is about to order when he sees Doreen behind the cashier.
“ummm, excuse me, but can you let the lady in the red know Vashon is out front and wants to talk to her.” The man, her father, called to her, but not before eyes Vashon suspiciously. Doreen walks up to Vashion, a slow paced walk that lets suggest to him that she’s been walking back and forth all day.
“what do you want” Doreen asks.
“Well, I wanted to know about school”
“Vashon, I’m working right now, but they’re going about as well as I could hope”
“what do you mean…nursing right? You going to school in the city”
“nah, I got into Brooklyn College.”
The only thing that separated them was the thing yellow counter, a color to signal the bright spirit of the restaurant and to signal to the people outside that this, indeed, was the place to fulfill your jerk chicken and curry goat needs, but the space between them felt much larger than that.
“Doreen, we need you in the back to help unpack to coconut milk. We just got a shipment”
“hey, Vashon, I actually need to get back to work”
And at that moment Vashion, seeing Darcy n being called back into action while also slowly building a nursing career, that he wasn’t in high school anymore. The lights above flickered. Well, that clearly needs fixing, Vashon thought to himself. He thought about everything he did in high school (or at least everything he could remember doing), it was a blur. But then, again, why should he put so much effort into remembering a thing that he spent so long trying to forget.
 
The restaurant felt empty, but it actually wasn’t. Inside the yellow countertop and green painted walls contrasted the chrome greyness outside. Vashion almost thought to himself but the thunder and roar of the passing Long Island Railroad shook the windows of the place. It’s a miracle that the twenty years that this restaurant has been around that the place has only been broken into once.  The train interrupted his thinking, a reprieve from the actually taking of responsibility, but it came back. His high school days.
 
It was third period and Vashon sat in the back of the class. Gameboy in hand. It was the old Pokemon Crystal, the second-generation handheld game. But the match teacher, the one, guess where? From Jamaica who had been teach the black kids of Brooklyn math with an iron stick for the pass twenty years. They typed who asked for your parents personal number during parent-teacher conferences and would personally call them on occasion, which he did, including in instances when we was particularly mad at the class or even one student, his name was Ivan (his mother was a Guyanese store clerk and took care of white children on Sundays). Dr. Joseph, apparently he was a doctor, threatened to call his mom but didn’t the first week of class. Which he did, but Ivan didn’t care, or at least he didn’t seem to. Ivan was always an interesting kid. Vashon never paid him any mind (too busy playing video games in the back of the class, drawning anime and manga characters in his notebook, imaging his female classmates with their shirts off, especially Darcy…but Ivan was something altogether different. They got into one fight, he remembers, back when they were in Jr. high school. He couldn’t remember what it was even over.
He came to school when he felt like it, and typically showed in the True religions that were in style then. Vashon had a pair too, but they laughed at him then.      
 
Vashon peeked from over the top of his Gameboy to see the commotion. A school officer was suddenly in the room and Ivan was face first on the ground. He looked on with passing interests. He looked on the ensuing scene as someone might look at a doll in display in a store window, which is to say while novel in its own way, he had already seen other types of dolls. Should he be mad? He was a pretty rude kid. He actually kinda felt pretty good about it. The handcuffs came out. Oh, the novelty took on a different shade. Even in places like Brooklyn, handcuffs weren’t something one say everyday, especially if you were the kind of kid who generally followed the West Indian edict of going straight home after school. Not that Vashon got invited many places. His childhood was one that he remembers mostly through what he saw mediated through a screen. The safest thing to do he always rationalized to himself.
“Darcy, I need to ask you something” said Vashon
“What is it?”
“Have you seen any penguins lately?”
“wha..”
“Penguins like out of your peripheral vision”
“no, Vashon…are you ok?”
“I got to go Darcy”
Vashon in a hurry exited the McCampbell’s, but not before quickly returning back to the counter to retrieve his jerk chicken. Any problems he might be having with imaginary Penguins aside, he wasn’t losing out on an opportunity to chow down on his favorite dish.  
Vashon turns the corner as soon as he exits the restraint. He’s on Fulton Avenue now, and he hears the loud chatter of the LIR. He looked up and saw not a train but a billboard advertisement for a Travel Agency. Their mascot? A tall penguin with frayed eyebrows.
 
…
“It was an emperor penguin. The bastards think they’re getting to me.”
Vashon finds himself in his room again, starring at the computer screen. His eyes are gonna go bad. He knows that, but he needs to figure this out.
 
 
Ivan is walking down the street. Air Force ones, it was that kind of day. He’s on Flatbush and walks into the giant McDonalds. Unknown to everyone else in that establishment, with the exception of on person, nobody really knows why he’s there. He takes a seat by the rare door, a second entrance for the people on the side street. He looks toward the casher register. The guy ordering is a white guy who looks homeless based on his tattered rags.  He leaves the register with a large cup in one hand and a cheese burger (dollar menu) in the other. He sits down in front of Ivan.
“Did you know that most of the black people you meet in New York are West Indian?” The mystery man, said. My folks are actually from the south, Mom spent her whole life in Texas, Dad grew up in Virginia. You West Indian people really be out here. Where you from again?
“Guyana”
“…”
“Which island is that?”
“anyway, straight to business, I like that. Hey, Somebody I know likes you a lot. Likes that job you did for them. Wants you to do something else just like it. There can be some real money in it for you, not this weed stuff that I give you every month.”   
“I’m down”
“You sure?” said the homeless man.
“You know the school library in Manhattan?”
“Nah, I don’t really enter the city.”
“Well, You’ll see it for the first time when we get up there next week”
 
Vrooooom went the gray sedan striking down the I-95. The brown folder rattled under the seat of the passenger side, it’s contents struggling not to spill out on the car’s carpet flooring, a carpet littered with weed stems, and other materials. The sound of the beat shook the car weapons. He thought he was gonna die, his head slumped against the passenger side window. The beat went on and on. His heart was racing with it down. He felt like the car and the beat. He was high as fuck. What did they even just steal. The folder continued the rattle on the floor, the windows continued to rattle against his skull, but he felt one with it, just like he was sure the car felt one with him, and certainly as sure as Dante was driving the car, speeding down the highway. He looked mad, like a certain Trinidadian man he had heard them speak of at the corner store. His eyes, Dante’s, were inflamed. He was jumping in his seat in a wild ecstatic joy. He was bursting at the seems. He proved the whole world wrong, even though the world did not know his name. He felt like he conquered it, even though he was but a speck on the cosmic scale. He didn’t care. Like a child who stands behind his parent’s leg and sticks his tongue at the cashier currently enmeshed in business, he felt like he had stared into the face of unreality on smiled, laughed even, as he was doing now. Like a mad criminal who had gotten away, who didn’t know the value of the thing he stole, but knew other people valued it. He was Batman. He finally did it. What could that man Vashon have meant anyway. He did it. It was a success. Weed really puts everything into perspective.
 
He found himself on the beach. He had never seen the ocean up close before. With each receding wave, he saw mixed paraphnelia on the beach. Sea shells obviously, and if you looked closer maybe even small animals. But other things too. Trash, rotting fruit. The white sand seemed stained. He looked out onto the water. Giant white machines in the distance. That was it. He looked at the scattered materials. Maybe Dudley was right. Maybe he should head to Jamaica for a stint. Make some money and, from there, make his way to the United States. He walked up to the large pile of trash and picked up what looked to be a flimsy newspaper, bright colored. Action Comics he repeated to himself. Squak. He turned around. In the distance, he saw it again. A small bird-like animal. It’s trying to talk to him. He started running. He held onto the newspaper. It was the hidden thing that brought the bird back. He ran towards it. Squack. He heard it again. Did he see its mouth move?
He needs to know. He wasn’t just running to the bird. He was running toward his destiny. He was running toward his future. He felt it. What do you mean? He saw it. He was there…nothing was around. He looked around. Was it a hallucination? He pulled the spliff he still had in his pocket. He lit it with the lighter he had in his other pocket. He knows what he saw. He exhales the chrome smoke.
He took a closer look at the newspaper he hand in his hand. It likely fell off the side of one of those boats. It wasn’t a newspaper. Action Comics. A white man on the cover wearing his underwear on the outside lifting a card with one hand. He heard of this guy. Superman.  It was a sign. The penguin is trying to tell him something. He knows what he has to do. He has to meet Superman. The man who can save anyone. He needed to go back to Dudley. He would have the answers.
 
He found himself boarding the plane. It was a success. He was getting on the plane to see Dudley. The man he hadn’t seen in over thirty years. The last time he saw Dudley, he was still a chubby kid. The kind of chubby kid who stood out in a Caribbean culture, especially like the one he knew growing up. He wondered how Dudley was doing and how he had been over the years. He was finally going to get the help he needed too. The help he finally realized he needed.
 
 
“I’m so sorry, mom” Said Vashon. “I just wanted you to be proud of me”
“We wanted the best for you. You didn’t need to be perfect. You were always enough.”
He embraced her, and sobbed into her shoulder. Even after everything, she was still there because she understood. She shared the same thoughts, experienced the same fears, and came to similar conclusions. It was empowering to give her that hug.
 
Plot Scene 3:
“Check this one out. It’s called “contents’ Ivan said. The first line, he read with a high-toned voice.
“nigga, that’s the table of contents” said Virgil.
“oh” replied Ivan.
The hallway was crowded and we were all huddled against the southmost stairwell. Class had just ended and the lunch rush was just underway. The lights in the hallway felt especially bright. Ivan and Virgil walked down the crowded hallway.
 
War interlude:
Interlude: The hotel was generally nice, though I wish I could say the same for the people who worked there. I thought all Jamaican people being rude was a myth. Granted, I’ve seen my fair share of rude Jamaican people in the restaurants in Brooklyn. Anyway, back to the hotel. There was no room service, and when I asked for an extra towel the woman just looked at me. I think she might’ve even sucked her teeth at me. Like this…chhhhhhhh
 
Plot: Scene 7:
“The folder isn’t here, Vashon!” crackled the recorder in his ear. Virgil stood there stunned. Everything he worked toward led up to this moment., but somehow he had known this. He had always known this; that his fate and the fate of the man staring across from him where intertwined. It was black outside, and he standing on the roof of one of the world’s most famous research libraries…The folder isn’t here, Virgil, we got to get out of here, how do we get…the crackling ended and there was silence on the other end. Virgil couldn’t listen. Ivan was standing on the other end of the roof. The roof was cluttered with debris. The crackle of the walkie talkie was replaced by the whizzing of the approaching helicopters. They had called the police. Of course, the police where called. There was something different about Ivan. Then suddenly, “I can’t let you leave here alive, Virgil.” His voice cracked. It started to rain. Hard rain drops. Cold rain drops. The kind of rain drops that lets you know it’s about to flood. It’s always raining in this part of New Haven; as if Nature herself is attempting to wash something away, something toxic about the place this library calls home. Maybe it’s the library itself. The whirl of the helicopters gets louder. “Shit” Virgil thinks to himself, I need to leave. This whole plan was a wash. Ha!, a wash, it’s raining, Virgil thinks to himself. Virgil is surprised he can make a joke in a moment like this. “Damn, maybe I’ve changed,” Virgil says out loud.
   	The Virgil saw something incredible. Something he couldn’t have anticipated. The shadow returned. Ivan with folder in hand emitted a shadowy presence. The masked eagle appeared over Ivan’s head. The god was with him now. Virgil felt relieved yet oddly abandoned. Ivan had inherited the power. What did that mean? Another sound, this one an approaching motorcycle…playing Ghost Face Killah…aww shit. “It’s almost done, Virgil!.” You should probably give up. “You should probably give up now”
“Give up now? Doreen we ain’t even get to the jerk chicken yet”
“Always a comedian”
Ghost Face Killa’s lyrics were getting louder. Fuck

He felt like he was living a life he didn’t recognize. That he had reached adulthood, but wasn’t prepared. He had done the best he knew he could do, but couldn’t help but feel that he had missed out. He had done some things sure, but wasn’t the reason why he felt so different from everyone else is because he was alone most of his life, literal isolation it felt like. His worst fear was that he had never learned how to live with people, despite being married all those years. That he needed help as a kid, never got it, and now was living with the repercussions with slightly more help now, but it’s like fighting a flood.  That moment when you realize you look way too much like your father and what’s scarier is when you act like him too. When you notice your feet are hurting and you’re not even standing on them.
*This is the split consciousness of Afrosamurai*
It comes to him suddenly like a dream. Why are they coming again? The smell of jerk chicken.
The door opens to a chime. The inside walls of bright yellow. He looks toward the register and he catches a glimpse of long raven black hair. He hears the soft hum and a reggae tune on the speaker. It warms his ears as the wafting scent of rice and peas reminds him of that with the right amount of cabbage, there really wasn’t a better meal in the world.
He waters plants. He hears a slight wrrrrz in the distance. Leaves at the front of the lawn swirling.
 
Quickly salt water shallowly filled his lungs and sputtered out of his body-one last forceful exhale before he returned to the doomed land of the living. If he was out spaced out by the water, if he was struck dumb by the return of all his sense, the fleeting sense of elation, ebbed his way as he looked up and saw the brightness of the full moon. He remembered. He was going to die tonight. The plan. There was no way he was going to live through this night. He heard the sliding of a boat on shore. It was Dudley carrying the boat. Screaming, pulling with all his remaining strength, the boat.
He stumbles up,  tries to run but falls face first into the crashing waves. It’s raining. A Smoove darkness.  He could see perfectly.

Vashon never paid him any mind (too busy playing video games in the back of the class, drawning anime and manga characters in his notebook, imaging his female classmates with their shirts off, especially Darcy…but Ivan was something altogether different. They got into one fight, he remembers, back when they were in Jr. high school. He couldn’t remember what it was even over.
He came to school when he felt like it, and typically showed in the True religions that were in style then. Vashon had a pair too, but they laughed at him then.  	
 
Vashon peeked from over the top of his Gameboy to see the commotion. A school officer was suddenly in the room and Ivan was face first on the ground. He looked on with passing interests. He looked on the ensuing scene as someone might look at a doll in display in a store window, which is to say while novel in its own way, he had already seen other types of dolls. Should he be mad? He was a pretty rude kid. He actually kinda felt pretty good about it. The handcuffs came out. Oh, the novelty took on a different shade. Even in places like Brooklyn, handcuffs weren’t something one say everyday, especially if you were the kind of kid who generally followed the West Indian edict of going straight home after school. Not that Vashon got invited many places. His childhood was one that he remembers mostly through what he saw mediated through a screen. The safest thing to do he always rationalized to himself.
“Darcy, I need to ask you something” said Vashon
“What is it?”
“Have you seen any penguins lately?”
“wha..”
“Penguins like out of your peripheral vision”
“no, Vashon…are you ok?”
“I got to go Darcy”
Vashon in a hurry exited the McCampbell’s, but not before quickly returning back to the counter to retrieve his jerk chicken. Any problems he might be having with imaginary Penguins aside, he wasn’t losing out on an opportunity to chow down on his favorite dish.  
Vashon turns the corner as soon as he exits the restraint. He’s on Fulton Avenue now, and he hears the loud chatter of the LIR. He looked up and saw not a train but a billboard advertisement for a Travel Agency. Their mascot? A tall penguin with frayed eyebrows.
 
…
“It was an emperor penguin. The bastards think they’re getting to me.”
Vashon finds himself in his room again, starring at the computer screen. His eyes are gonna go bad. He knows that, but he needs to figure this out.
 
 
Ivan is walking down the street. Air Force ones, it was that kind of day. He’s on Flatbush and walks into the giant McDonalds. Unknown to everyone else in that establishment, with the exception of on person, nobody really knows why he’s there. He takes a seat by the rare door, a second entrance for the people on the side street. He looks toward the casher register. The guy ordering is a white guy who looks homeless based on his tattered rags.  He leaves the register with a large cup in one hand and a cheese burger (dollar menu) in the other. He sits down in front of Ivan.
“Did you know that most of the black people you meet in New York are West Indian?” The mystery man, said. My folks are actually from the south, Mom spent her whole life in Texas, Dad grew up in Virginia. You West Indian people really be out here. Where you from again?
“Guyana”
“…”
“Which island is that?”
“anyway, straight to business, I like that. Hey, Somebody I know likes you a lot. Likes that job you did for them. Wants you to do something else just like it. There can be some real money in it for you, not this weed stuff that I give you every month.”  
“I’m down”
“You sure?” said the homeless man.
“You know the school library in Manhattan?”
“Nah, I don’t really enter the city.”
“Well, You’ll see it for the first time when we get up there next week”
 
Vrooooom went the gray sedan striking down the I-95. The brown folder rattled under the seat of the passenger side, it’s contents struggling not to spill out on the car’s carpet flooring, a carpet littered with weed stems, and other materials. The sound of the beat shook the car weapons. He thought he was gonna die, his head slumped against the passenger side window. The beat went on and on. His heart was racing with it down. He felt like the car and the beat. He was high as fuck. What did they even just steal. The folder continued the rattle on the floor, the windows continued to rattle against his skull, but he felt one with it, just like he was sure the car felt one with him, and certainly as sure as Dante was driving the car, speeding down the highway. He looked mad, like a certain Trinidadian man he had heard them speak of at the corner store. His eyes, Dante’s, were inflamed. He was jumping in his seat in a wild ecstatic joy. He was bursting at the seems. He proved the whole world wrong, even though the world did not know his name. He felt like he conquered it, even though he was but a speck on the cosmic scale. He didn’t care. Like a child who stands behind his parent’s leg and sticks his tongue at the cashier currently enmeshed in business, he felt like he had stared into the face of unreality on smiled, laughed even, as he was doing now. Like a mad criminal who had gotten away, who didn’t know the value of the thing he stole, but knew other people valued it. He was Batman. He finally did it. What could that man Vashon have meant anyway. He did it. It was a success. Weed really puts everything into perspective.
 
He found himself on the beech. He had never seen the ocean up close before. With each receding wave, he saw mixed paraphnelia on the beach. Sea shells obviously, and if you looked closer maybe even small animals. But other things too. Trash, rotting fruit. The white sand seemed stained. He looked out onto the water. Giant white machines in the distance. That was it. He looked at the scattered materials. Maybe Dudley was right. Maybe he should head to Jamaica for a stint. Make some money and, from there, make his way to the United States. He walked up to the large pile of trash and picked up what looked to be a flimsy newspaper, bright colored. Action Comics he repeated to himself. Squak. He turned around. In the distance, he saw it again. A small bird-like animal. It’s trying to talk to him. He started running. He held onto the newspaper. It was the hidden thing that brought the bird back. He ran towards it. Squack. He heard it again. Did he see its mouth move?
He needs to know. He wasn’t just running to the bird. He was running toward his destiny. He was running toward his future. He felt it. What do you mean? He saw it. He was there…nothing was around. He looked around. Was it a hallucination? He pulled the spliff he still had in his pocket. He lit it with the lighter he had in his other pocket. He knows what he saw. He exhales the chrome smoke.
He took a closer look at the newspaper he hand in his hand. It likely fell off the side of one of those boats. It wasn’t a newspaper. Action Comics. A white man on the cover wearing his underwear on the outside lifting a card with one hand. He heard of this guy. Superman.  It was a sign. The penguin is trying to tell him something. He knows what he has to do. He has to meet Superman. The man who can save anyone. He needed to go back to Dudley. He would have the answers.
 
He found himself boarding the plane. It was a success. He was getting on the plane to see Dudley. The man he hadn’t seen in over thirty years. The last time he saw Dudley, he was still a chubby kid. The kind of chubby kid who stood out in a Caribbean culture, especially like the one he knew growing up. He wondered how Dudley was doing and how he had been over the years. He was finally going to get the help he needed too. The help he finally realized he needed.
 
 
“I’m so sorry, mom” Said Vashon. “I just wanted you to be proud of me”
“We wanted the best for you. You didn’t need to be perfect. You were always enough.”
He embraced her, and sobbed into her shoulder. Even after everything, she was still there because she understood. She shared the same thoughts, experienced the same fears, and came to similar conclusions. It was empowering to give her that hug.
 
Plot Scene 3:
“Check this one out. It’s called “contents’ Ivan said. The first line, he read with a high-toned voice.
“nigga, that’s the table of contents” said Virgil.
“oh” replied Ivan.
The hallway was crowded and we were all huddled against the southmost stairwell. Class had just ended and the lunch rush was just underway. The lights in the hallway felt especially bright. Ivan and Virgil walked down the crowded hallway.
 
War interlude:
Interlude: The hotel was generally nice, though I wish I could say the same for the people who worked there. I thought all Jamaican people being rude was a myth. Granted, I’ve seen my fair share of rude Jamaican people in the restaurants in Brooklyn. Anyway, back to the hotel. There was no room service, and when I asked for an extra towel the woman just looked at me. I think she might’ve even sucked her teeth at me. Like this…chhhhhhhh
 
Plot: Scene 7:
“The folder isn’t here, Vashon!” crackled the recorder in his ear. Virgil stood there stunned. Everything he worked toward led up to this moment., but somehow he had known this. He had always known this; that his fate and the fate of the man staring across from him where intertwined. It was black outside, and he standing on the roof of one of the world’s most famous research libraries…The folder isn’t here, Virgil, we got to get out of here, how do we get…the crackling ended and there was silence on the other end. Virgil couldn’t listen. Ivan was standing on the other end of the roof. The roof was cluttered with debris. The crackle of the walkie talkie was replaced by the whizzing of the approaching helicopters. They had called the police. Of course, the police where called. There was something different about Ivan. Then suddenly, “I can’t let you leave here alive, Virgil.” His voice cracked. It started to rain. Hard rain drops. Cold rain drops. The kind of rain drops that lets you know it’s about to flood. It’s always raining in this part of New Haven; as if Nature herself is attempting to wash something away, something toxic about the place this library calls home. Maybe it’s the library itself. The whirl of the helicopters gets louder. “Shit” Virgil thinks to himself, I need to leave. This whole plan was a wash. Ha!, a wash, it’s raining, Virgil thinks to himself. Virgil is surprised he can make a joke in a moment like this. “Damn, maybe I’ve changed,” Virgil says out loud.
   	The Virgil saw something incredible. Something he couldn’t have anticipated. The shadow returned. Ivan with folder in hand emitted a shadowy presence. The masked eagle appeared over Ivan’s head. The god was with him now. Virgil felt relieved yet oddly abandoned. Ivan had inherited the power. What did that mean? Another sound, this one an approaching motorcycle…playing Ghost Face Killah…aww shit. “It’s almost done, Virgil!.” You should probably give up. “You should probably give up now”
“Give up now? Doreen we ain’t even get to the jerk chicken yet”
“Always a comedian”
Ghost Face Killa’s lyrics were getting louder. Fuck
 
 
So this is what nature feels.sounds like
Black girl digging in medicine pouch for antidepressant watching church sermon
Jamaica/Haiti gun for drug trade. Gangster obeah believer involved.
 
The double flames gang
I heard birds talking to each other and it sounded like they were screaming gang signs at each other. Kaww.
 
“I play my music loud to drown out the noise that’s in my head.” said

It was me, Christopher Lebron, and Anthony Reed. We were formed in a circle in the middle of theAfrican American Studies holiday party. Right away something felt good and familiar. It recalled a time when at the end of the day in highschool me and the guys would huddle in a circle outside the school’s doors. I don’t know who was the first to say it. Somehow, we landed on a conversation about Cappadonna’s verse on “Winter Warz,” a track that appeared on Ghostface Killah’s debut album, Ironman (1996). 
 
Months after my father died, I called Mr. Patterson. 


Growing up, a picture of my step-father hung on the wall of his and my mother’s bedroom. It was him, a presumably much younger man. He was standing outside a cave surrounded by the green leaves of trees dressed in military fatigues. My step-father was a forer soldier. But not for the U.S. military.
