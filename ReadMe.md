# Welcome to Shayne McGregor's Portfolio

Here is here you can stay up to date on all things related to my web development career, and this readme file is meant to serve as a guide through 
the portfolio. If you're interested in working with me, you'll probably be interested in one of the three folders within this repo. 

## 1. Projects
Within the projects folder, you can tell a look at all the projects I've worked on. 
## 2. Resume 
Here is where you can find an up-to-date version of my resume 
## 3. Homepage 
Here is where you can get to know me a little more by taking a look at how I wrote and organized the code on my personal website.
